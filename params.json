Typescript hero will be extended\r\nin the future and there are many features in the pipeline that will enhance the way you\r\nwork with typescript.\r\n\r\n## Features at a glance\r\n\r\nHere is a brief list, of what TypeScript Hero is capable of:\r\n\r\n- Add imports of your project or libraries to your current file\r\n- Add an import for the current name under the cursor\r\n- Intellisense that suggests symbols and automatically adds the needed imports\r\n- Sort and organize your imports (sort and remove unused)\r\n- Restart your debug session when your code changes\r\n\r\n## Commands\r\n\r\nAll commands are preceeded by `typescriptHero`.\r\n\r\n| Command                      | Extension part  | Description                                               |\r\n| ---------------------------- | --------------- | --------------------------------------------------------- |\r\n| showCmdGui                   | general         | Shows a small gui with all awailable internal commands    |\r\n| resolve.addImport            | import resolver | Shows a pick list with all recognized, importable symbols |\r\n| resolve.addImportUnderCursor | import resolver | Imports the symbol under the cursor                       |\r\n| resolve.organizeImports      | import resolver | Removes unused imports and orders all imports             |\r\n| resolve.rebuildCache         | import resolver | Rebuilds the whole symbol cache (or index)                |\r\n\r\n## Keybindings\r\n\r\nThe following commands are bound by default when the extension is installed.\r\n\r\n| Command                      | Keybinding         |\r\n| ---------------------------- | ------------------ |\r\n| showCmdGui                   | `ctrl+alt+g`       |\r\n| resolve.addImport            | `ctrl+alt+i`       |\r\n| resolve.addImportUnderCursor | `ctrl+alt+shift+i` |\r\n| resolve.organizeImports      | `ctrl+alt+o`       |\r\n\r\n## Settings\r\n\r\nIn the following tables, all possible settings are explained. If you find any\r\nsettings that are not listed here, that means they are \"beta\" or \"not implemented yet\".\r\n\r\nAll settings are preceeded by `typescriptHero`.\r\n\r\n### General\r\n\r\nThese settings do not have a prefix.\r\n\r\n| Setting   | Description                                                                |\r\n| --------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\r\n| verbosity | The log level that the extension writes its messages to the output channel |\r\n\r\n### Import resolver\r\n\r\nThe following settings do have the prefix `resolver`.
